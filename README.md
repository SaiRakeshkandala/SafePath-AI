1. Users input their **start** and **destination** locations.
2. SafePath AI analyzes nearby **crime and safety data** (via API or mock data).
3. The app suggests the **safest path**, showing real-time updates on the map.
4. If you enter an unsafe zone, the **voice alert** system instantly warns you.
5. Users can also **share local safety tips** on the community feed.
